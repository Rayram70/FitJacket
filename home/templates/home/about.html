            Our platform is simple, intuitive, and designed to get out of your way — so you can stay focused on what matters: showing up.

          <h3 class="text-red">Why We Exist</h3>
          <p>
            We created Fitjacket because we saw a gap between performance and accountability. Spreadsheets and notebooks don't scale. Social platforms are too noisy. We wanted a focused, motivating space just for fitness.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you're here, you're already ahead. Let’s go further together.
